Predictive analytics: Predictive analytics is a branch of advanced analytics that makes predictions about future outcomes using historical data, statistical modeling, data mining techniques and machine learning. In AIOps, teams use predictive analytics to find data patterns and identify risks and opportunities.

AIOps uses AI to optimize the performance of enterprise IT environments, ensuring systems run smoothly and efficiently. AIOps platforms use ML and big data analytics to analyze vast amounts of operational data to help IT teams to detect and address issues proactively.

Benefits of AIOps:

Faster mean time to repair (MTTR)
By cutting through IT operations noise and correlating operations data from multiple IT environments, AIOps can identify root causes and propose solutions faster and more accurately than humanly possible. Accelerated problem identification and incident resolution processes enable organizations to set and achieve previously unthinkable MTTR goals.

Lower operational costs
Automatic identification of operational issues and reprogrammed response scripts reduce operational costs and drive more precise resource allocation. It also reduces IT staff workloads and frees up staffing resources for more innovative and complex work, improving the employee experience.

Better observability and collaboration
Integrations within AIOps monitoring tools facilitate more effective collaboration across DevOps, ITOps, governance and security teams. And better visibility, communication and transparency enable these teams to improve decision-making and respond to issues faster.

Predictive ITOPs management
With built-in predictive analytics capabilities, AIOps platforms continuously learn to identify and prioritize the most urgent alert. This helps IT teams address potential problems before they lead to unplanned downtime, disruptions and service outages.

Group the alerts â€“ 
for example, if the EHR system experiences a network outage that affects multiple servers and applications, AIOps groups all the alerts related to the network outage into one incident.
